                <p><b>PARTNERSHIP FIRM FORMATION/RECONSTITUTION AND DISSOLUTION:</b> Partnership firms in India are governed by the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. While it is not compulsory to register your partnership firm as there are no penalties for non-registration, it is advisable since the following rights are denied to an unregistered firm. Dissolution of a partnership firm merely involves a change in the relation of partners; whereas the dissolution of firm amounts to a complete closure of the business. When any of the partner's dies, retires or become insolvent but if the remaining partner's still agree to continue the business of the partnership firm, then it is dissolution of partnership not the dissolution of firm.</p>
                <p><b>APPLYING PAN AND TAN:</b> Permanent Account Number (PAN) is a code that acts as identification of Indians, especially those who pay Income Tax. It is a unique, 10-character alpha-numeric identifier, issued to all judicial entities identifiable under the Indian Income Tax Act 1961. TAN is applied through "Form No. 49B" (prescribed under Indian Income Tax Law). A completed form can be submitted online at the NSDL website or at the "Tax Information Network Facilitation Center" (TIN-FC). These centers are established by NSDL, an appointed intermediary by the Central Government, across India. TAN is required to be quoted in all TDS/TCS returns, all TDS/TCS payment challans and all TDS/TCS certificates to be issued. TDS/TCS returns will not be accepted if TAN is not quoted and challans for TDS/TCS payments will not be accepted by banks. Failure to apply for TAN or not quoting the same in the specified documents attracts a penalty of Rs. 10,000.</p>
